# 🔐 FastAPI AuthApp — Simple Login and Registration System

## 📌 Overview

This is a lightweight authentication system built using **FastAPI** and a modern, animated HTML frontend. It allows users to:

- Register with a username and password
- Log in with their credentials
- Receive immediate visual feedback via animations and styled UI

Password storage uses **bcrypt hashing**, and the interface is responsive with smooth UI transitions between login and registration modes.
